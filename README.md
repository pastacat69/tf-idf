## What is TF-IDF?
Statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in the context of a category, ocument, or collection of documents.
It is commonly used in the analysis of textual data.

## Briefly Overview
Typically, TF-IDF is determined for each word. 
The higher the value of this measure, the more significant the word is in the context of the category, document, or collection.
This measure also allows for the consideration of commonly used words, reducing their significance in the context of the object being analyzed.

## TF
`Frequency of the word in a specific category/document/collection (depending on the data being analyzed)`

## IDF
`Inverse document frequency (popularity of the word)`
